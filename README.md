This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Getting Started

1. Create a firebase app with authentication and firestore.

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env.local` file and fill in the environment variables of your Firebase app.

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Start it up

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Runs the app in the development mode.
   Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. 
   
   The page will reload if you make edits. 
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.
